abstract = {Bayesian networks are graphical modeling tools that have been proven very powerful in a variety of application contexts. The purpose of this paper is to provide education practitioners with the background and examples needed to understand Bayesian networks and use them to design and implement student models. The student model is the key component of any adaptive tutoring system, as it stores all the information about the student (for example, knowledge, interest, learning styles, etc.) so the tutoring system can use this information to provide personalized instruction. Basic and advanced concepts and techniques are introduced and applied in the context of typical student modeling problems. A repertoire of models of varying complexity is discussed. To illustrate the proposed methodology a Bayesian Student Model for the Simplex algorithm is developed.}
