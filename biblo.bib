abstract="In this paper, we present an approach to hierarchical knowledge representation for the student's evaluation in propositional logic. The hierarchical evaluation consists in assessing the student's state of knowledge at several levels of granularity. The relevance of the method is justified by the need for a precise and flexible diagnosis of the learner's skills in a given domain. For that purpose, we shall model the propagation of the evaluation from a specific level of knowledge content to more general levels, using Bayesian inferences and neural networks classifications.",

abstract="A learner model must store all the relevant information about a student, including knowledge and attitude. This paper proposes a domain independent learner model based in the classical overlay approach that can be used in a distributed environment. The model has two sub-models: the learner attitude model, where the static information about the user is stored (user's personal and technical characteristics, user's preferences, etc.) and the learner knowledge model, where the user's knowledge and performance is stored. The knowledge model has four layers: estimated, assessed, inferred by prerequisite and inferred by granularity. The learner model is used as a part of the MEDEA system, so the first and second layers are updated directly by the components of MEDEA and the third and fourth are updated by Bayesian inference.",

abstract="A standing question in the field of Intelligent Tutoring Systems and User Modeling in general is what is the appropriate level of model granularity (how many skills to model) and how is that granularity derived? In this paper we will explore models with varying levels of skill generality (1, 5, 39 and 106 skill models) and measure the accuracy of these models by predicting student performance within our tutoring system called ASSISTment as well as their performance on a state standardized test. We employ the use of Bayes nets to model user knowledge and to use for prediction of student responses. Our results show that the finer the granularity of the skill model, the better we can predict student performance for our online data. However, for the standardized test data we received, it was the 39 skill model that performed the best. We view this as support for fine-grained skill models despite the finest grain model not predicting the state test scores the best.",

volume={14},
pages={63-96},
abstract={Belief networks provide an important way to represent and reason about uncertainty -- significant factors for modelling students. These networks provide a way of structuring such models, and allow a system to use a systematic approach when gathering information about the scope of the student's knowledge. This work also provides a theoretically-sound way to update the student model, based on the concept of a dynamic belief network. The relationship to related research is discussed. Finally, the paper describes why the barren node concept is important for computational efficiency in belief-net-based student models.},

abstract="In this paper we present an extension of a previously developed generic student model based on Bayesian Networks. A new layer has been added to the model to include prerequisite relationships. The need of this new layer is motivated from different points of view: in practice, this kind of relationships are very common in any educational setting, but also their use allows for improving efficiency of both adaptation mechanisms and the inference process. The new prerequisite layer has been evaluated using two different experiments: the first experiment uses a small toy example to show how the BN can emulate human reasoning in this context, while the second experiment with simulated students suggests that prerequisite relationships can improve the efficiency of the diagnosis process by allowing increased accuracy or reductions in the test length.",
